# Week One Self Assessment
### William Jackson

- Describe your work this week. What do you work on/produce? Include links to relevant documents (GitHub, etc.)
  - This week we concentrated on developing a set of instructions for building a lego structure. Once the instructions were developed, we had a class mate work through the instructions and assemble the legos.
