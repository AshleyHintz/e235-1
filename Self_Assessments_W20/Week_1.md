# Week One Self Assessment
### William Jackson

- **Describe your work this week. What do you work on/produce? Include links to relevant documents (GitHub, etc.)**
  - This week we concentrated on developing a set of instructions for building a lego structure. Once the instructions were developed, we had a class mate work through the instructions and assemble the legos.
  - [Lego Instruction Set](WJackson_Lego_Instruction_Set_W20.md)
  -  We also learned how to set up a GitHub account as well as set up a repository, upload files, and pull requests.

- **What do you think you learned?**
  - The main thing I learned during this first week was to use GitHub on a very basic level. 
  - I learned how to use basic syntax commands in Markdown to develop files in GitHub.
